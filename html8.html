<h3 style = "border:2px solid Tomato; color=blue;">CSS Introduction</h3>
<p style = "background-color: Green; color:white">Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more.</p>
